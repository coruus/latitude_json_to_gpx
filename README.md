# latitude_json_to_gpx - convert Latitude Takeout to gpx

A very simple Python script to convert Latitude Takeout json files to a
segmented GPX track, reasonably suitable for importing into, e.g., Adobe
Lightroom, or some other geotagging application.  Relies on [gpxpy](https://github.com/tkrajina/gpxpy)
to do the heavy lifting of generating a GPX file.

Only uses latitude and longitude information, because under 0.3% of the
datapoints in my latitude.json contain elevation information. (If you
really need elevation information, look at [gpxtools]
(https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gpxtools), which can automatically insert
elevation information into a GPX track.)

You can configure how long of a gap between segments you'd like to
segment the GPX track into by passing a command-line argument.

If you need output in other file formats, take a look at Scarygami's
[latitude-json-converter](https://github.com/Scarygami/latitude-json-converter),
which I discovered only after I wrote this script. 

Install gpxpy before using this script:
 pip install gpxpy

## Usage 
    usage: latitude_json_to_gpx.py [-h] [--segment_gap SEGMENT_GAP]
                                   [--output OUTPUT]
                                   path/to/latitude.json
    
    Convert a latitude.json file generated by Google Takeout to a GPX file,
    suitable for import into Lightroom, or other geotagging applications. Go to
    https://www.google.com/takeout/ to download an archive containing your
    latitude.json file.
    
    positional arguments:
      path/to/latitude.json
                            A latitude.json file produced by Google Takeout.
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --segment_gap SEGMENT_GAP
                            the number of hours between data points to trigger
                            generating a new track segment in the output GPX file
      --output OUTPUT       the file to store the output in
